We may love your products and renew yearly, which makes the issue seem irrelevant with most of the subscription prices matching current pricing(not sure if after the first year of subscription for new customers they get that renewal discount, eg $29 a year for Webstorm).You\u2019ve stated that we can purchase a license or renewal prior to the switch and be great for a year, and it\u2019s fantastic that you support this\u2026yet  it has a cut off point which again messes with that security of our investments into your products, several years from now if we stop we\u2019ll be \u2018luckier\u2019 than the new customers and be able to fall back to our perpetual license from 2016\u2026For some products going back that many versions may not be too viable, the customer can then either hop back on the subscription wagon, or if alternatives offer a similar/better experience the customer may jump ship. You\u2019ve made your users feel locked in with this subscription model, if they do not continue payments they will not be able to use the IDEs with features that they might depend on daily. As mentioned earlier, this is probably unlikely to happen for the majority of your users, JetBrains makes great products, I\u2019ve just finished my first year with WebStorm and offered a renewal for $29, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll be great with my current version for some time, but happy to support a great product provided I can afford it in my budget( $29 is sadly still quite a bit for someone in my situation ). I am safe to do this renewal it will be just like the previous year, but after that any new updates I get via the subscription model cease to exist \u2018if\u2019 I stop payments.I believe this has been a very clear explanation of the problem   It would be great if you implement what others have suggested. After 1 year( or paying for 1 year of subscription in advanced ), entitle the loyal user to a perpetual license of the product from when that 1 year subscription ends. If this is not desirable on JetBrains end, then compromise with either a license that allows the loyal customer to use the software for a period of time without new updates, 12-36 months, whatever you deem appropriate would surely be better than a straight cut off of access. Another alternative would be to provide this with an increase in subscription fee, the price increase may disgruntle users, but at least you can offer them the security of a perpetual license of the version they last used via subscription \u2018should\u2019 they stop payments.",

The version I have now is the only one I\u2019ll be able to use if I want to stop upgrading. If that time occurs in 2019, I\u2019ll suddenly revert back to IntelliJ 14 (basically making it useless).I\u2019ve seen it suggested a few times in this thread already: why not allow users to \u201ckeep\u201d the version they last paid an entire year for? Meaning that if I subscribe until November 2019 and then cancel, I\u2019ll be able to revert the version of IntelliJ that was current in November 2018.

I have a hard enough time getting the current version approved when we add new people.  The main problem that I have is that I don\u2019t mind paying for a license from time to time, even a personal license for personal projects.  The problem is that I may not use the app for months at a time (work on .NET for a few months and Java, or perhaps SCALA).  I don\u2019t need all the new bells and features and tend to skip upgrades from time to time.  Now I can\u2019t.  You lost a very loud advocate for your product in a large organization.

We\u2019re wanting to be treated fairly, and for Jetbrains to make money, fairly.A subscription model just feels unfair, even if we end up spending less $$ with you, overall. This is why we have always loved your old licensing model, it felt fair, even if you raised prices, we could choose or not choose to continue to purchase.These are not micropayments. If I dipped into an IDE for an hour to fix a bug from code I wrote last year in Python, and a $0.40 charge was applied to me from Jetbrains, I wouldn\u2019t have any issue, if I didn\u2019t have to enter a credit card, it was totally seamless, etc.  If I am regularly using the product, then yeah, I\u2019d like a monthly or annual subscription and not worry about it. You\u2019re kind of in the painful middle where there\u2019s a bunch of cognitive \u2018noise\u2019 in a devs head about whether it\u2019s worth it.THAT is the worst place to be. Developers have to do everything they can to avoid distraction and cognitive \u2018noise\u2019 in their jobs. The LAST place we want cognitive load increased from, is from our tools vendors.Anyway, hope that helps explain it. It\u2019s the subscription model, not the $$, that matter here. This is (I\u2019m guessing!\u2013correct me if I\u2019m wrong Matthieu) why Matthieu says he\u2019s willing to pay for a subscription, as long as he could also get a perpetual. We want choice and to not have to \u2018worry\u2019 or be forced to make these economic decisions on a monthly basis.  [I think my replies supporting Sven's idea would advance Jetbrains goals a lot, not totally, but enough and it might alleviate a lot of customer churn and revenue loss otherwise. See Netflix's attempting to separate DVDs from streaming \"too early\" from a few years ago, as another example that blew up.]",

I really hope I\u2019m missing something because it seems like you are increasing price by 67% versus the original $239/year AND losing the ability to use the software if you decide to cancel. I\u2019m honestly afraid my company won\u2019t accept that.I was recently able to convince our group of 12 to switch from Eclipse to IDEA and saving money on dropping JRebel at the same time (because they felt burned by its subscription model). I think we could get past the subscription part as we planned on doing yearly upgrades anyway, but the price bump to $399 a year AND losing features I honestly don\u2019t understand.

How about if I subscribe for a year?

Or just for the PyCharm sub? If the latter, what happens re: switching plans away from PyCharm then back?",

But as I haven\u2019t become a paying customer yet I expect that to be taken with a grain of salt.It has made a less-than-ideal impression on me that the year over year prices are generally higher than the previous upgrade path, particularly given the inability to keep the last version. If you are considering the \u201ckeep after 12/18/whatever most\u201d option, that would be a major plus for me as a prospective paying customer. In an effort to make that even more realistic, I offer this: I would personally understand were that option not available on the Toolbox edition, where it makes less sense, and I would personally understand if that option applied only to the last version, and then only after the next version were out for some period of time.In other words, if you release IDEA 16, 17, and 18 on a yearly schedule and I quit before 18 is out for, say, a month, it'd seem reasonable to me to only grant a perpetual license to 16. If I quit after 18 were out a month, I\u2019d get a license to 17. That would address the \u201cgot the new version, rush of cancellations\u201d issue with the basic idea, while still giving a lot of incentive for people to continue a subscription. They will end up trying the next version because of the one month rule so they have a chance to get hooked on it. If they don\u2019t continue after that, their tooling moves backwards..From my POV, the bonus here is that you would have considerably more incentive to make 18 good, otherwise I\u2019d cancel and keep 17 once I tried 18 for a month.In essence this becomes a yearly upgrade model with monthly payments available and incentives set up for maximum retention while still preserving some level of permanent value and risk mitigation for the customer. You would have a more attractive and steady income to you with the monthly payments, as well as an excuse to ditch the \u201cfirst year X, subsequent years X*.5\u2033 pricing model I suspect isn\u2019t working for you. And I think the described model would lure quite a few people into staying subscribed year over year. Everyone would end up trying the newest version, and nobody wants to move backwards in their tooling so they\u2019re likely to keep it. EAP does this already to an extent but this would catch more people. And it\u2019s considerably less hostile than taking the tooling away entirely.I\u2019ll contact Sales for the rest of my questions. Thanks again for the considered answer.",

No more updates till you pay again\u2026then if you have a break like that then the clock starts again before you get the perpetual.That would appease most people I\u2019m sure. If Adobe did that they would have my Lightroom money now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+1Given the firestorm of complaints here, I think if you made this *one* modification, you would ease the criticisms substantially. After 12 mos, or an annual subscription, you can drop off, keep your current version indefinitely\u2013then join again later to get updates. Those updates go away if you only stay for a month or 11 (meaning you revert back to the version you qualified for by staying subscribed for 12 mos or more), but after a year of re-subscribing, you get permanently bumped up and perpetual again as long as you stay current (or you stop at the version you last had 12 mos of subscription for).Best of old and new models.

Although combined with Sven\u2019s idea above, perhaps there could be a fee to get back to a perpetual license status\u2013without having to wait 12 months\u2013I guess that\u2019s just the cost of the 12 month subscription.I\u2019d prefer that I just lose my \u2018updates\u2019 that I get (within 30 days of not connecting in to Jetbrains servers), if I haven\u2019t subscribed for at least at year. Once I\u2019ve subscribed for a year\u2013as described in my restatement of Sven\u2019s idea directly above this post\u2013then I get a perpetual license that is good until I stop subscribing.The only main loss (penalty if you were) in this idea, is that you\u2019d lose updates/bug fixes back to the last time you were subscribed for 12 mos or more, so that\u2019s a bit of a penalty, but not much and doesn\u2019t feel so much like you\u2019re a hostage of Jetbrains. Feels fair, to me at least.By way of a further example, say if I subscribe for 32 months, from versions 2.2.0 to 4.8.1, then let my subscription lapse in the 33rd month, when 4.8.1 was the latest, then I get to use 4.8.1 indefinitely, forever, but with no updates (other than perhaps security patches); no features, maybe 4.8.x bug fixes that are product destabilizing, but definitely no new features. If later I decide I want to subscribe again, at the 40th month perhaps, I get the newest 4.9.2 that\u2019s out then, but if I lapse and don\u2019t renew after the 43rd month, then I revert back to 4.8.1\u2026 if however I subscribe from the beginning of the 40th month through end of the 51st month (12 more months), then I get perpetual for the version 5.2.5 that\u2019s was last released in the (maybe 49th) month.

The full toolbox does look like a very nice price point in fact. But not having access to any version at all (even an older one from the start of the subscription/cycle) if I take a break in the subscription as my interests and financial position change outweighs that entirely.In my view, the price of software is a investment and maintenance in a tool, not a running cost.Somebody else here has already suggested that after 12 months you \u2018unlock\u2019 a perpetual no-upgrades license for the version from from the start of that cycle.

Your FAQ states \u201cThe offer is available to customers with or without upgrade subscriptions regardless of the subscription status, provided a customer switches their existing licenses to the new model before January 1, 2017\u2033. When you say \u201cswitches their existing license\u201d, it implies that after we switch, we now have a subscription license and our perpetual license is gone, and that\u2019s completely unacceptable.Secondly, this new PHPStorm pricing scheme is an outright insult. If I ever let my subscription lapse, my price gets jacked up to $99/yr for a piece of software I don\u2019t even get to keep? Right now I\u2019m paying $49/yr and I keep the last version of the software I paid for. Why would I rent something for $99/yr that I was previously owning for $49/yr? Every other company I can think of that has moved to a subscription model has done so with a decrease in price because there\u2019s an inherent decrease in value associated with not getting to keep the software when you stop paying. How is it you feel justified in doubling your prices while simultaneously decreasing value?I love your software, but I honestly can\u2019t justify giving more money to a company so obviously out of touch with their smaller customers.",

Well, I\u2019ll try one more time.I know it doesn\u2019t change anything, but in case you\u2019re keeping count, I am one of your customers that won\u2019t be returning.I\u2019ve been struggling more and more the last couple of years with the various small bugs and usability problems in the IntelliJ core (which means that they also exhibit in AppCode and CLion) and was trending towards potentially giving the next version a miss. However, seeing your new plan to force me into upgrading has allowed me to say for sure that it won\u2019t be happening.Aside: I am fully aware of how your bug tracking system is supposed to work. You think it\u2019s democratic and gets the most important bugs fixed and I think that the way it works it\u2019s impossible to get any bug, big or small, fixed. I\u2019ve ridden this merry-go-round. I\u2019m not going to convince you and you\u2019re not going to convince me, so lets do each other the courtesy of not bothering, OK?Call me a Curmudgeon if you want (many do) but I don\u2019t want to rent my software. I want to reach into my pocket, remove some of my hard earned cash, and slide it into your pocket in exchange for owning a copy of your software. Yes, I\u2019m aware, I don\u2019t really \u201cown\u201d anything, I just have a license. However, a perpetual license is like owning a thing; a thing that can\u2019t be taken away from you in the future if you don\u2019t keep up the payments.It\u2019s a little hyperbolic, but a subscription model is akin to a ransom demand or a protection scheme. (\u201cThat\u2019s some nice code you have there. It would be a shame if something were to stop you from refactoring it.\u201d). Maybe you don\u2019t see it that way, but I do. Maybe others do too; I don\u2019t know.In any case, no hard feelings and I wish your company well. From the looks of things you\u2019re losing customers, but you\u2019ll likely end up gaining some new ones, so it will all work out.My only regret is that I won\u2019t get to ever use CLion on a project; I\u2019m one of the many votes to have something other than CMake as a build system. As such I bought into it to support future development that I hoped would include my ability to actually use it, but c\u2019est la vie.Incidentally, I would like to add that you cherry picking a couple of tweets that support this new scheme and putting them in the post is really irksome. It\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to say \u201cHey look, everyone supports this!\u201d. No. No we don\u2019t. Please don\u2019t put words in my mouth.",

Every software company should understand, there ARE alternatives and they are growing and becoming better too! And where there aren\u2019t alternatives or good alternatives, a competitor always hits the market, especially when things like this gives THEM an opportunity to do so!I just renewed my license for PHPStorm 9, I would had _NOT_ done that, if I knew that suddenly I can\u2019t keep pay when and if I need another update, say in an year, because I\u2019ll be enforced into a different model in future with which my software would be locked down.

Time will tell whether your new business model works out. You will keep larger clients, but I see smaller developers abandoning JetBrains in droves over this.

Never have I seen such a tight fisted penny pinching bunch that make so much money! Oh, everything must be free or developers will sufffer!I\u2019ve been using IntelliJ since about version 1.6, it was the first decent java IDE and all of JetBrains\u2019 products have been at the forefront of empowering developrs. My power and reach as a developer has been greatly enhanced by their products and I think the current fees are quite modest. I\u2019m going to upgrade my tools every year as long as I use them, so I don\u2019t see any real difference, well, except that since I use multiple tools I get HUGE price break on my annual costs. The cost of JetBrains\u2019 tools are not bad at all, especially when you consider their quality, their constant improvement and what the alternatives are.But I\u2019m a professional developer and have been for three decades. If you\u2019re not a pro, and are broke, then use the community editions. If you aspire to be pro, then you need to understand that you have to spend money to better make money. I estimate that JetBrains improves my productivity by 20% or more. To me that\u2019s a great improvement at a low cost. Really, it would be foolish to not take advantage of tools that make you a better developer than those who use lesser quality tools.If you\u2019re a pro and are whining, go use the free OSS tool of your choice. I am happy to compete with you in the market and be able to do much more than you because you find such small fees intolerable. My costomers hire me because I get so much done in a short period of time and I know all of their languages and frameworks and have plugins that talk to their ecosystem, thanks for helping me out, JetBrains!For those who threaten to leave and never use the tools again, you are not telling them that they are losing a good customer, you are telling them that you aren\u2019t a good customer to have, one who can\u2019t do simple arithmetics, can\u2019t make simple business decisions based on productivity, who doesn\u2019t believe the company is going to last or that it wants to form a good long term relationship with their customers. I believe that the negative concern with perpetual licensing is foolish. Development tools get stale, you need them to adapt to the constant change in the software industry and you aren\u2019t going to be happy with an old version even if this new licensing regime hadn\u2019t appeared. So the demand makes no real sense since the tool becomes useless after a few years no matter what the licensing. If you leave now then for all intents and purposes you have exercised the natural outcome for you perpetual license. If you want timely upgrades, then you are probably already upgrading your license anyway. Really, paying less is bad?Would I prefer to pay less and get more and have everything work the same way forever? Sure, who doesn\u2019t, but I understand that JetBrains is trying to keep the business on an even footing, and really, the cost to the customer is improving and is giving them the ability to make better plans and decisions. I want JetBrains to thrive for the rest of my career, so I\u2019m going along with this without hesitation. Are you going to be using one language/tool/system for your 45 year career?

The complaints mainly seem to be that some people like to skip releases and delay subscriptions, but when you add up the costs that\u2019s actually more expensive unless you skip upgrades for years. It is emotional more than anything, you will pay more for a perpetual license rather than subscribe at a lower price? For me that means I\u2019ll pay about 1/3 as much since I used a lot of their tools. Plus I\u2019ll keep IntelliJ up to date even though I rarely write java anymore.If I were making decisions at JetBrains I would read the complaints as an imperative to continue the perpetual license (hurrah! says the crowd), but double or triple the annual fees for them (on no!, but at least we got what we wanted so we feel better and feel like we won, says the crowd).

It\u2019s especially important for Jetbrains, who relies on developers feeling positively enough about the tool to recommend it to friends.

It is too much effort for an organisation, which is not developer-centric, yet has development teams working on internal projects.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpeaking of which (the projects). In such a company it is often the project is frozen in some state for quite some time. Therefore there is no valid business reason to continue to pay renewals and receive new features, but the application still has to be supported in one way or another. Perpetual license fits in very well. For example: you have one team supporting current application and another prepping for the new one? You just upgrade those licenses that are needed.I propose a slightly different renewal model.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMonthly subscription? Be it so, however, should the sub be cancelled, the current version of IDE will continue to work indefinitely. There simply won\u2019t be updates.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf i, say, decide to come back, i will be charged the time difference up to the cost of a new subscription.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSay, i didn\u2019t use IDE for 3 months? Upon reactivating the license i\u2019d have to pay standard monthly fee + 3 months before it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI come back in 6 months? 1 + 6\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI come back in 18 months? I pay 1 + 12 (a year) and nothing more. (as if i actually bought a perpetual standard license given the old model).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd also add functionality for license key file generation from the customer account page, that can be fed to the IDE (to circumvent the aforementioned corporate network restrictions).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDoes that make sense?",

I believe JetBrains completely forgot who their customers are and what they are selling by making this annoucement. Software developers are above average intelligent people. IDEs are not movies or music or television shows that are continuously made available on Netflix, Spotify or Apple Music. Nor do you provide access to resources as file storage, Internet bandwith or virtual machines where we can run your software as a service. In addition. there is no downside for JetBrains with this new licensing scheme at all. Only if you would provide a bug fix guarantee, say for every month after the first you have not fixed a bug that is critical for said user, the monthly fee is waived, a subscription model makes sense to me. If your are not willing to let the payment model go both ways, your are nothing but greedy.From a sales perspective, recurring revenue is the wet dream of any bean counter. But I fail completely to see why you should deny your customers perpetual licenses to run your software in a shipped version, installed on our own computers.Robert Demmer, you and your colleagues are going to have a long Monday answering all the questions related to this blog post, but I have some more for you:1. If JetBrains decides to discontinue any product under the new plan, how will you ensure that subscribers still can use that product?2. If JetBrains goes bankrupt, how will you ensure your subscribers can use the products they subscribed for?The last question, improbably as it may seem, is actually a real requirement for many organizations when acquiring software.",

Let\u2019s try the housing analogy: If you buy a flat then it costs more than 100,000 dollars but it\u2019s yours. You still have to pay for renovation (license renewal) but you always get to keep the last version forever. On the other hand, you can rent the flat for less than 1,000 dollars a month and the owner will do some basic repairs, but you need to move out if you stop paying. This is basically the same and it establishes the rules for pricing: If you switch to renting out your software, then drastically drop the prices!Let\u2019s see about that with PhpStorm: As an individual developer I pay 99\u20ac for the first year and then 49\u20ac each year for renewal. That means paying 197\u20ac over the course of three years, ob 66\u20ac per year. If I get the existing customer \u201cspecial price\u201d then I already did pay those 99\u20ac and I still need to pay that same 49\u20ac per year but the license expires if I stop paying thus throwing me back to the \u201cexisting customer\u201d version. This reduces the quality of the license while staying at the same price. On the other hand, if I don\u2019t get that discount, then it will be 79\u20ac per year, costing me 237\u20ac over the course of three years. That\u2019s a price increase of 20.3%, which incidentally is slightly above the allowed maximum increase in rent over the course of three years here in Germany.What does the current planning mean for me? I will renew my license one last time should a new version of PhpStorm become available before November 2nd. That\u2019s it. You would never see a cent from me again.What would be changed to keep the users? First of all, keep the current licensing model as an option. Heck, even bump the renewal a little from 49\u20ac to 59\u20ac. If the users feel that the software \u201cis theirs\u201d, then they\u2019ll gladly pay a bit more than for the subscription model. Secondly, the subscription pricing is much too high. The price needs to be cut in half, to something like 19..29\u20ac per year.

In that book he describes how most of the best growing companies make their money by delighting their customers to the point that they don\u2019t even have to advertise\u2026their customers do it for them.  These customers are called \u201cPromoters\u201d.  It also describes how companies that are in decline have customers that hate them, called \u201cDetractors\u201d.  These companies make their money by various hidden fees and subscriptions, similar to what you attempting to do.  It explains the Net Promoter Score.  It explains the difference between good profits vs bad profits, and much more.  I recently joined an extremely successful company, and the first thing they made us do was read that book.  With the move towards a subscription model, you are about to turn a whole army of JetBrains promoters (happy customers) into an army of detractors (angry customers).Please JetBrains, I urge you to continue to offer the perpetual license.  If you want to add an additional subscription option, go ahead, but don\u2019t FORCE us into it.  You are trying to make more money by annoying your customers, not delighting them.If you need to raise prices on WebStorm to align with other products, then do it.

The subscription model is indeed more expensive than the current price structure \u2013so I am a little sad \u2014 but at the same time, it\u2019s not like the economics of running a business remain unchanged. Costs increase and so the price eventually has to increase \u2014 this is life. Also, the current JetBrains IDE offerings are still a lot cheaper than Visual Studio \u2014 even though the subscription model became a little more expensive, it still retains a lot of value. I remain a fan of JetBrains and I will continue to support them. I have been using the free version of PyCharm for a long while and I am very grateful for this, so I\u2019m also happy to read that JetBrains will be continuing the community edition. Since there is a limited window of opportunity to get cheaper subscription pricing, I now have to make my purchase earlier than I thought, but this is not a big deal for me.I will admit though that my first reaction to the subscription pricing wasn\u2019t pleasant as I view subscription models in general to be lower in value (the point made by other commenters about the loss of service once monthly payments stop is the main reason why I view subscription models as lower in value). Then I became more annoyed once I realized that the subscription pricing is also more expensive than the current pricing model.However, JetBrains has always been a great company in the past so, in my mind, they definitely deserve the benefit of the doubt. It\u2019s honestly hard for me to really view JetBrains as a greedy company that only cares about the bottom line. They make great products and they have supported Linux from the start. We need more companies like this, not less. I do have a few questions though:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1) Assuming I am on the subscription model for PyCharm and I know that I will be needing the CLion IDE later for a different project, am I allowed to switch my license from PyCharm to CLion for some time (so that I am locked to only using CLion during the subscribed months)? Or will I need the Toolbox subscription at that point?2) Let\u2019s say I take advantage of the cheaper PyCharm subscription price because I had purchased a license from the older pricing structure. If, after a year, I decide that I would need to get the Toolbox subscription, would I be eligible for the discounted price of that as well?3) How long will the discounted subscription pricing last for users who have opted to convert their perpetual license to a subscription license?4) Will CLion ever officially support Arduino?Thanks\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChris",

The existing incentive of continuing to improve the product in order to get people to upgrade can vanish if everyone is automatically on a recurring subscription.

Since they are in the core, they affect all of the tools I use.I was thinking of maybe giving the next version a miss to see what would come down the pipe, because I don\u2019t think that constantly focusing on some big new feature or features is really working for them; bugs pile up in old and new features and you end up with a mish-mash of semi-usable features.Yes, in the end in comes down to what happens when you stop paying. It also comes down to what happens if you are for some reason FORCED to stop paying (i.e. temporarily lose your job, etc), what happens when something stops it from being able to phone home, and most importantly, what happens in the company decides to just stop developing it all together, and a myriad of others.Personally I find the idea of renting software abhorrent and I\u2019m not even fully in the position that I use it to make a living; it\u2019s just an ideological thing.However if one of the many schemes that have been presented that would allow my version to keep working  if I had to/needed to/wanted to stop paying were in place, I would have no problem.

Not just because I want the latest and greatest features (aside of updated language support, there\u2019s not that much I need), but also to support you people.Over time, I\u2019ve added licenses for IntelliJ, ReSharper, AppCode and 0xDBE will probably happen too at some point.

ReSharper I don\u2019t need any more, so I\u2019m not keeping that subscription up to date.Looking at what I\u2019m currently paying for, I really like the idea of the new all-products subscription: It costs me less and I don\u2019t have to renew various support contracts (which is what the extensions currently are) at different times, so that\u2019s nice.However.Right now I know that if worse comes to worst \u2013 if I somehow need to work for a prolonged time without internet access or if I am at some point in the position of not being able to pay for the support contracts any more, then I still have the safety net that the stuff that is on my machine right now, I will be able to use no matter what.By turning this into a subscription, you\u2019re taking this safety net away from me.Even excluding horror scenarios: Right now I can take my Laptop which I use very rarely, take it on vacation where I have no or only really expensive internet and I can be sure that the version of IntelliJ I have installed on that Laptop is going to be there for me. No need to remember to have it phone home before I go, no checking for subscription status \u2013 nothing.This convenience is very important for me and I would be willing to pay extra for this.For some people \u2013 probably many corporate users, this doesn\u2019t matter much, but for me this is really important and this is why going subscription only actually bummed me out quite a bit.If you can find a way to guarantee your fixed income while still providing us users with a safety net, even at a premium price, I would really appreciate that.Philip",

        "value": "I for one am all for the subscription model, and it simplifies my life, and tool chain greatly.  I primarily use PHPStorm, and will use RubyMine, and CLion, Resharper, and PyCharm as required.  As much as Idea is a good platform, and language plugins are available \u2014 they aren\u2019t designed around the specific language, and I\u2019ve went back to the tuned products, which yield a significant productivity boost.Having a subscription for all products is -much- better, and I am going to be able to explore and use more software in a realistic setting over months throughout a product lifespan, rather than just trying to make do with a 30 day trial.   In addition, it means I will always have the newest version with newest language/toolchain support as well. The subscription for PHPStorm will be $2/wk.  Which is still ridiculously cheap, and anyone who has any skill should be able to afford a year with a single short term contract.    I will personally shell out the $6/wk for the full toolbox suite, because I will haphazardly use different supporting language throughout the year; and I can live with the equivalent of one less latte a week.  But then, that is what I personally saw when I basically told many clients to drop the US market entirely, as they provide much resistance to paying for their tools, that simply doesn\u2019t exist in most of the world.  The services range in price from USD 10 to USD 100 per month, and every step of the way, only the US market was complaining about subscriptions, price-hikes, and the like.  While most of Europe, Korea/Japan, and South America had no strong feeling, and are still increasing in revenue.    And after dropping the US market entirely from support and service, in one case, 95% of the negative comments, internet fires, and PR-mitigation required vanished entirely.    This is true to such an extent, I have personally had several companies based out of the SF Metro Area, to cease their free-services/premium prices, and switch to a pay-model, and cut out all US support.  Needless to say, they were hesitant at first, but after a few months, the resulting financials convinced them.I am in all my future contracts, always making this suggestion for any Internet based company to dramatically increase revenue.  Ditch the US market, who are trained to have things for free; and focus on the rest of the world, that are willing to pay a livable and reasonable amount for goods and services.It\u2019s hard to believe that Americans can be so poor, and underpaid, and have to resort to badgering others to do work for free.I personally know many people (I am not sure what your definition of \u201ca lot\u201d is; but I personally know around 20 developers who are in support of the subscription model, 40 who don\u2019t care either way, and maybe 2 who is staunchly against it.).    So, \u2014 yes, the majority in my world-view, are in support, or at worst, apathetic on the matter.To me it also seems as if most of the vitriol seem to be coming from people located in the USA.  Are developers there so underpaid that people can\u2019t easily afford to pay what is effectively a trivial amount for their tools; and to support the company that is developing and constantly improving on them?",

Meanwhile, the company is adding more features on top of bugs that really need looking at.\nAnd there\u2019s the problem. Jetbrains doesn\u2019t have the resources to fix the bugs and implement new features. So what do they do? They prioritise building out the feature set because we \u2013 the customers \u2013 won\u2019t upgrade otherwise. How many people here have said that they skip a few revisions until a feature comes along  that they need? One of the main reasons that folk are against the subscription model because it will rob them of the ability to skip versions.\nAnyway, what this means is that features get added, and bugs get fixed when they have time. What\u2019s worse is that if a new feature has bugs, it probably won\u2019t get fixed if it takes time away from adding a feature that will ensure people upgrade.\nThe subscription model will allow them to focus on bug-fixing. This is vital, so one way or another, the subscription model is here to stay, even if they bring some sort of perpetual licence as well.But the phone-home thing is a non-starter in my opinion. Here\u2019s a few suggestions:1/. Just go with the yearly subscription. Not sure why you need the monthly one.2/. When a subscription is purchased, just download a file that gets checked locally when the IDE starts up. Pretty much the same as you have now. If the subscription expires, then just flash up a dialog box every 15 minutes. There is no need to stop folk from working. I know this means trusting your customers, but we\u2019re also trusting you to deliver solid software with an improving feature set during the subscription year. Trust runs both ways.3/. Restore the perpetual licence.Someone already suggested only allowing EAPs to run through the subscription. This is a brilliant idea. You have to be a subscriber to get the latest and greatest as soon as it\u2019s ready. Perpetual licence holders have to wait until the   next version is released.\nThere are probably loads of other incentives you can offer subscribers. As well as the extra tools and IDEs, they could have preferential support. After a year, you get a mug, the year after, you get a t-shirt. (Okay, I\u2019m just throwing stuff out there now).",

Projects I don\u2019t even earn money with. Projects I touch from time to time, maybe 4 times a year. A subscription is too expensive for my personal projects. Maybe I should mention that we decided to use IntelliJ IDEA in the company *after* I had a couple of great months working on personal projects. I know that some of my colleagues have personal licenses for education and \u201cplaying around\u201d. I guess they will have the same problem with the subscription.\n- for my company a subscription model is no option! We have to bee free in the decision when we invest money for upgrades.Please keep in mind that most other subscription services offer more than just software you download. Atlassian Cloud for example. In that case a subscription model is ok since the offering includes hosting, backup, maintenance! It\u2019s more than just a piece of software that we run on our own devices.\nSame with services like Evernote, Dropbox etc. And even Office365 is different since Exchange and some other services run in the cloud and Microsoft takes care of hosting, backups, security etc. !That\u2019s a major difference to your plans. You want to have a subscription fee for software that every user runs on his local machine! Storage, backup, repository are still our responsibility. Your new model offers no extra service that I or my company is willing to pay for. I\u2019m really disappointed and sad! Sad because I really love your products! Sad that we have to migrate back to Eclipse or NetBeans if we want to stay up to date and avoid the subscription.\nDisappointed because I always had the feeling that JetBrains is somehow \u201cbetter\u201d than some of the \u201cbig ones\u201d.",

And that you will not be discontinuing the ownership of software, not now, not 1 year from now, not ever.Now here is where the time part comes in\u2026\nYou will need to do something over time- you\u2019ll need to raise the prices of owned software, and owned renewals. You can\u2019t do this now, since you already have ill will, but a year from now you can do a little, and a year from that a little more, etc.\nGradually over time, your pay prices increase relative to your subscriptions, which will make the subscriptions more attractive. When customers perceive value, you will not have to convince them.  They will knock down your doors for your subscriptions, and gradually you will see a shift in your business from \u201cbuy once\u201d to license.Some great examples of this:\nApple Music ($10 a month for all the music you want, vs $10-14 for a single album)\nCodeSchool \u2013 in this \u201cfounders talk\u201d video Gregg talks about how he priced his courses for purchase vs subscription, strongly favoring the subscription price to influence buyers decisions https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/founder-s-talk-part-3 it\u2019s a 2 hour video, and a must watch for any entrepreneur.",

In thinking about your new licensing model, I find it hard to justify a paid monthly subscription. All my software development projects to date were donated to the requestors. I can\u2019t cost-justify software rentals since the money comes out of my personal income and I can\u2019t pass the cost through to someone else. The rental prices appear to be a hefty increase in my annual cost for just the WebStorm product. JetBrains products are great, but they are used in a hotly competitive market where a lot of very gifted developers are in competition and perhaps seeing relatively little financial reward. I think a subscription model works best if you either start the business out that way and a subscription model is a natural fit for the product, and/or you have a near monopoly on a market segment, and you can force your customers to pay.  For example, subscriptions would work well with dynamic DNS services. Users can accept that kind of service/subscription model. But subscriptions would seem to be a much less natural fit for IDE software, which has always been distributed either for a single license fee, or at no cost at all. Telling a developer that he or she will have to pay up or the software will shut down then and there, in mid-project, is distressing. I had IntelliJ do exactly that to me and after considering what my project would be used for, I decided not to pay the $200. So it rather feels like I\u2019ll be paying a substantial amount of money under the threat of seeing my projects shut down totally. With a threat like that, maybe I had better look more closely at Eclipse, and perhaps try to contribute to it. Dissatisfaction with licensed software did give the world Git, and Git works great!",

This is probably because the CEO (maybe unknown to JetBrain\u2019s employees) is positioning the company for sale.

In places it was already present, I helped to expand its adoption even in the light of some management who had the [mistaken] impression that Eclipse was just as good for free.  In addition to my license(s) that I have for my clients, I am a professional software development contractor, and have my own license that I pay for every single time there\u2019s an upgrade path.  Money is not unreliable, and I have never balked or reconsidered purchasing a license \u2013 you really do make great products.

I suspect these people are the main reason that Jetbrains felt the subscription model necessarily.I agree, and it seems like the real reason why this is happening, although it may not have been said exactly that way.The problem with this is that it should have pointed out to them that what they were doing wasn\u2019t working, so perhaps striving for the new, great features was the wrong way to go and more focus on fixing defects might have had more draw for the people that were not upgrading.Obviously I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but for me personally, the reason I don\u2019t like this model is 100% the lack of perpetual license. I was already considering the software a yearly subscription anyway. Even if there was a 0% discount between subscribing for a year or subscribing month to month, I would go for a year anyway. Money is not the issue.If the situation was identical to what it is planned except that anyone that subscribed for a year at a time received the same perpetual license to whatever version was final at the end of that year (as it works now), I would be a happy camper. Higher price or lower price? Doesn\u2019t matter.Now, in the other thread I said I was trending towards giving the next version a miss, and that was 100% due to the fact that software defects that actually affect me are not being addressed at all (unless you count having the \u201cfix in build version\u201d continually advanced to a future build).I would 100% give them another year under this new system to see how they use this new revenue stream to address things. Would we start seeing a regular monthly point release that addresses bugs? I would hope so. Even if the bugs fixed were not the ones that I constantly bump against, at least I would regain hope that mine would be gotten to in time, because after the last few years, I\u2019ve lost that.However I need the assurance of a perpetual license.

I\u2019ve seen many a software deal killed on that alone.Personally, I\u2019ve almost pulled the trigger a few times on both PyCharm and CLion, but haven\u2019t yet. Maybe that makes my opinion worthless. I\u2019m an almost sale, who hasn\u2019t ever paid you a thing.Personally, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be working on Python and C forever- but I am going to be for the foreseeable future (years). In the subscription world if I stop doing Python and C work I\u2019d cancel my subscription and lose all access to the tools. If I have to dive back in briefly, I would probably learn another IDE (I would _not_ simply pick up a license for a month) or use a text editor. If I still owned a license, I would probably be back in the IDE, and thinking about upgrading.So, like others I have these suggestions:After a year of subscriptions to a tool, the current version of that tool becomes a permanent license, and no longer needs to phone home. Ever.Allow a full year to be purchased in advance with no automatic reup, no phone home requirement and the option to upgrade through the year. (Essentially, traditional)I can, and will, do the reasonable subscription prices per month for PyCharm and CLion if it leaves me with a usable copy when I cancel my subscription. I won\u2019t do it if I\u2019m left with NOTHING to show for all my cash. Because that\u2019s what you leave people with after hundreds and hundreds of dollars- NOTHING.",

What happens if there\u2019s fatal incompatibilities or problems in a new version and I need to stay on an old one? Take a look at the Adobe CC 2015 debacle for example, there are bugs in it that make it just plain fail to work and there\u2019s no way to revert to the working 2014 version because the subscription\u2019s for the current version. For a professional whose livelihood depends on their tools working this isn\u2019t a viable situation, we need to know we have a fallback if things go off the rails.One solution that\u2019d work for me is a provision that if you\u2019ve paid for at least 1 year of subscription, if you don\u2019t renew the license automatically converts to a perpetual license for the versions your subscription was on when it ended. Combine that with a provision that a license covers all earlier versions and I\u2019m safe.Financially the subscription makes little difference, it costs me the same amount under both systems, but I need assurances in the license terms that I won\u2019t find the world suddenly yanked out from under me.

Firstly I don\u2019t like the subscription model initially, but after looking into further as an existing customer, I actually started like the new model once I start calculate my cost. Before: I need to pay IntelliJ for 299 to start, renewal at 99, my total cost for 3 years are 299+198 = 497, for 10 years, 299 + 99*9 = $1190 (I have paid WebStorm, but looking into get IntelliJ recently)After: I only need to pay $119*3 = $357 for 3 years. 10 years, I pay $1190 (current customers I would pay $267 for 3 years, and $890 for 10 years.Why don\u2019t I do it? (May be somebody can help me check the math) If my math holds, why don\u2019t you JetBrains do this on the site show us these Math? You marketing folks should be fired for not putting this up on your site, but rather let your customer like me to figure it out)What\u2019s the caveat? I can think of a few;\n- Do I always need internet connectivity to use the tools? (so it can check license entitlements on-going basis?)\n- If I stopped paying for whatever reason, I\u2019ll be locked out from the tool? I can see this is a major barrier for developers.(who are not used to subscription model today, you\u2019ll need to pay the price to educate them into this model, actually this post is one)\n- For developers/enterprises do not use the products continuously may think this is a rip-off, but once they see the math above, I think they can get over it.\n- The above math is good to explain to customers have been seen the value of keeping it up to date, but for new acquisitions, e.g. grad kids from school not knowing whether they want to renew down the road, they may compare the initial cost against multi-year costs just because he/she thought no need to renew in next a few years), you may have stiff acquisition cost to educate them on value of continue to paying rather than forced to pay.\n- The last caveat is for you JetBrains, this is going to dis-incentivize you adding new features, may be less pressure and reduce you OpEx cost, but that may slow innovation in the space and bad for long run. But I would assume you thought this through.A few other questions for you:\n- What are you trying to accomplish from the new model? Increase revenue? (I didn\u2019t see that from my math above), but maybe I\u2019m wrong on my assumptions of the Math. But I definitely respect and admire companies trying to help their customer saves Money, (Those company will have longevity)\n- The second is that why not A/B testing before you force this November 2 date? (Since you had other subscription products, that should not be hard to implement?\n- Whats your current customer base how many uses multiple products? (which may benefit from the bundle offer?)Just throw some thoughts here, and hope it helps.",

The one thing that all large enterprises I\u2019ve worked for have in common is that they refuse a subscription model. They want to own the tools and not have to worry about budgeting for it every year. If they want to upgrade they can budget for it and make it a priority.I would much prefer to see both models available.

Any implied benefit to the customer is PR speak mixed with a dash of very unique situations.  In my own experience with companies that have abandoned perpetual licenses in favor of subscription, I see the level of new features drop drastically.  While the original blog post, and many replies from employees, have stated as much \u2013 this is simply a method to get continual payments for bug fixes.I\u2019m a small fish in a very big pond, I get that.  Me, personally, not upgrading or moving to a subscription model won\u2019t impact the bottom line of JetBrains in even the tiniest of ways.  I get it.

Maybe you want to reach the goal faster, maybe you want to reach the goal with a higher degree of precision. Whatever your definition of \u201cbest\u201d is, it\u2019s up to you choosing the right tool for the job. When you have your tool, you will use it again, and again, and again.At some point in time you might realise that there is another tool on the market that can enable you to reach goals in even a better way than you do now. Then you collect your money, buy your new tool and happily use it. Or maybe you are happy with your current tool, since the level of \u201cbest\u201d you reached is already more than satisfactory for your needs.I don\u2019t want to be \u201cforced\u201d to update my tool every month. Updating a tool every month requires money and, sometimes, a relevant mental effort in understanding how the latest bell and whistles work. Let\u2019s also say that I\u2019m a Java developer, and I predict that I will professionally write Java and only Java for the next 10 years. Why do I have to pay for the latest changes in Scala, Groovy, or \u2013 may I be forgiven \u2013 CSS plugins?I want to be free to buy my tools, use them, learn to accept their limitations or buy new ones when I grow out of them.

After that, they manufacture a bunch of the same tire rebranded as something else,  i.e.  as Motomasters , in Canada.   They are sold for less than what they charge for the major-name-branded ones, but they know that they would not have made an additional dime otherwise.

I do\n                                    not understand how Jetbrains can drag\n                                    themselves to the ranks of often,\n                                    lackluster subscription based software.I have long been a loyal and vocal\n                                    advocate for Jetbrains software and\n                                    customer service. Your software does make\n                                    my job easier and I do enjoy using it.

I\n                                    often go out of my way to explain why I\n                                    love using your products, like Webstorm and\n                                    PHPStorm, and have convinced many people to\n                                    switch to Jetbrains. After this decision, I\n                                    have no desire to continue advocating your\n                                    historically incredible software and intend\n                                    to make it very clear to potential users of\n                                    how you\u2019ve decided to treat loyal\n                                    users.This decision shows a lack of empathy\n                                    for the community you have worked so hard\n                                    to build and I am extremely concerned about\n                                    your future considerations of myself and\n                                    the rest of the community. Unless Jetbrains\n                                    decides to amend this new policy with\n                                    consideration for traditional, perpetual\n                                    based licenses, I will no longer be\n                                    purchasing new offerings. I will use the\n                                    current version of software. When I feel\n                                    they are no longer suitable for use, I will\n                                    look for alternatives offering perpetual\n                                    licenses or simply use a text editor.Again, your software does make my job\n                                    easier and I do enjoy using it, but I want\n                                    to make it clear that I do not need to you\n                                    your software. There are plenty of\n                                    acceptable alternative IDE's and, of\n                                    course, I can always use a standard text\n                                    editor.I hope Jetbrains can recognize the error\n                                    of their ways and address this issue in\n                                    response to the community.
